        Is Jimmy Buffett yacht rock? The answer is no. Yacht rock is a style of smooth, jazz-infused music from the late 70s and early 80s, featuring artists like Michael McDonald, Steely Dan, Toto, and Christopher Cross. Jimmy Buffett’s tropical and island-themed music, while beloved by many, falls under “Gulf and Western” rather than yacht rock. Learn more about yacht rock at Smooth Sailing Radio.
