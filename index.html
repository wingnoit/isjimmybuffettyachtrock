        Jimmy Buffett is often associated with beach music and the tropics, but most yacht rock fans agree he isn’t yacht rock.

        Is Jimmy Buffett yacht rock? The answer is no. Yacht rock is a style of smooth, jazz-infused soft rock from the late 70s and early 80s, featuring artists like Michael McDonald, Steely Dan, Toto, and Christopher Cross. Jimmy Buffett’s tropical and island-themed music, while beloved by many, falls under “Gulf and Western” rather than yacht rock. Learn more about yacht rock at Smooth Sailing Radio.
